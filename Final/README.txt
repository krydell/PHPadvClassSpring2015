For my final project, I would like to create a simple �virtual pet� web site. The gist of my idea is that a user would create an account and be able to adopt a �virtual pet� to their account, which would have a variety of statistics that can be changed and updated. 

	Tasks:

- Create username and login system using ACCOUNT CLASS

	~Basic registration that is stored in database (~2-3 hours)
	~With validation (~1-2 hours)
	~Password reset option (via security question?) (~2 hours)
	~Can view own profile (~2 hours)

- Create �pet� system using PET CLASS

	~With a user interface, a user can make a virtual pet that uses CRUD functions: 
	~Can create a new pet (~3-4 hours)
		x Choose its name
		x What kind of animal (dog, cat, etc.)
		x What color
	~ Read its current information (~2 hours)
		x Have a page that displays all of a user�s pets and their stats
		x Update its statistics (~2-3 hours)
		x Clicking �feed� buttons that would increase  a �happiness� variable, etc. (~2-3 hours)
                x and delete it from the database (~1-2 hours)

- Debug code, check for errors (~3-4 hours)

- HTML and CSS to allow for prettier user experience (~3-4 hours)

- Comment and clean up code (~3-4 hours)

	


	- Total estimated length to complete project: 24 - 32 hours
